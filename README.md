# Chat Hub
A blockchain chat app is a decentralized messaging platform that leverages blockchain technology to provide secure, private, and tamper-proof communication. Unlike traditional chat applications that rely on centralized servers, blockchain chat apps store messages and user data on a distributed ledger, ensuring data integrity, end-to-end encryption, and user control over their information.
